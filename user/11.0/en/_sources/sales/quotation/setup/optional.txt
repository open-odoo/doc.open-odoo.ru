How to display optional products on a quotation?
================================================

Overview
========

The use of suggested products is a marketing strategy that attempts 
to increase the amount a customer spends once they begin the buying 
process. For instance, a customer purchasing a cell phone could be 
shown accessories like a protective case, a screen cover, and headset. 
In Odoo, a customer can be presented with additional products that are 
relevant to their chosen purchase in one of several locations.

Configuration
=============

Suggested products can be added to quotations directly, or to the ecommerce 
platform via each product form. In order to use suggested products, you will
need to have the **Ecommerce** app installed:

Quotations
----------

To add suggested products to quotations, you must first enable online quotations 
in the Sales app from :menuselection:`Configuration --> Settings`. Doing so will 
prompt you to install the Website app if you haven't already.
