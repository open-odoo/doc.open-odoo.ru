counted as Users.</dd><dt >Bug</dt><dd >Is considered a Bug any failure of the Software that results in a complete stop, error
traceback or security breach, and is not directly caused by a defective installation or
configuration. Non-compliance with specifications or requirements will be considered as Bugs at
the discretion of Odoo SA (typically, when the Software does not produce the results or
performance it was designed to produce, or when a country-specific feature does not meet legal
accounting requirements anymore).</dd></dl></section><section id="access-to-source-code"><i id="enterprise-access-online"></i><h2 >3 Access to source code</h2><p >For the duration of this Agreement, Odoo SA gives the Customer a non-exclusive,
non-transferable license to use (execute, modify, execute after modification)
the Odoo software, under the terms set forth in <a href="#appendix-a-online" class="internal reference"><span class="std std-ref">9 Appendix A: Odoo Enterprise Edition License</span></a>.</p><p >The Customer agrees to take all necessary measures to guarantee the unmodified
execution of the part of the Software that verifies the validity of the usage
and collects statistics for that purpose, including but not limited to the
running of an instance, the applications installed and the number of Users.</p><p >Odoo SA commits not to disclose individual or named figures to third parties without the consent
of the Customer, and to deal with all collected data in compliance with its official Privacy
Policy, as published on <a href="https://www.odoo.com" class="external reference">Odoo SA's website</a>.</p><p >Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, this license is revoked immediately and the

actual number of Users for one year.</p></section><section id="service-level"><i id="services-online"></i><h2 >4 Service Level</h2></section><section id="bug-fixing-service"><h3 >4.1 Bug Fixing Service</h3><p >For the duration of this Agreement, Odoo SA commits to making all reasonable efforts to remedy any
Bug of the Software submitted by the Customer through the appropriate channel (typically, Odoo SA's
service desk email address or website form), and to start handling such Customer submissions
within 2 business days.</p><p >The Customer understands that Bugs caused by a modification or extension that is not part of the
official Software will not be covered by this service.</p><p >Both parties acknowledge that as specified in the license of the Software and in the <a href="#liability-online" class="internal reference"><span class="std std-ref">7.3 Limitation of Liability</span></a>
section of this Agreement, Odoo SA cannot be held liable for Bugs in the Software.</p></section><section id="support-service"><h3 >4.2 Support Service</h3></section><section id="support-scope"><h4 >Support Scope</h4><p >For the duration of this Agreement, Odoo SA offer a support service, with an
unlimited number of tickets for bugs and functional questions: how to use and
configure Odoo for your specific needs.</p><p >This support service does not include support to customize Odoo, develop new
modules, or perform specific actions on your database on your behalf. (e.g.
recording data, or configuring the system for you) Those services can be
offered in extra through our Success Pack service offer.</p></section><section id="id1"><h4 >Support Service</h4><p >Support issues should be submited online on <a href="https://odoo.com/help" class="external reference">https://odoo.com/help</a> In case of
emergency, you can call our support teams directly for a real time answer.</p><p >Our support teams are split across 3 continents in India (Ahmedabad), Belgium
(Brussels) and United States (San Francisco) in order to cover 20 hours per
open day. (monday to friday, excluding legal holidays in the respective
countries)</p><p >No guarantees are provided on the time to qualify or close a support ticket,
it's based on our best efforts. But 95% of the tickets are qualified within 2
open days, and 90% of the critical bugs (when a user can not work on the system
anymore) are processed within 2 hours.</p><p >The Odoo portal allows you to track you support tickets.</p></section><section id="service-availability"><h3 >4.3 Service Availability</h3><p >Customer databases are hosted in the closest Odoo data center (EMEA: France,
Americas: Canada, APAC: Hong Kong or Taiwan). Each customer instance is replicated
in real-time on a hot-standby system located in the same data center.</p><p >We work with different hosting providers worldwide (and we can switch at anytime),
but they always deliver at least 99.9% uptime guarantee. These metrics refer to
the availability of the platform itself for all customers. Individual databases
may be temporarily unavailable for specific reasons, typically related to the
customer's actions, customizations or upgrades.</p><p >Our data centers are Tier-III certified or equivalent, with N+1 redundancy for
power, network and cooling.</p></section><section id="backups-recovery"><h3 >4.4 Backups &amp; Recovery</h3><p >Every database has 14 full snapshot backups for up to 3 months: 1/day for 7
days, 1/week for 4 weeks, 1/month for 3 months. Every backup is replicated on
at least 3 different machines in different data centers.</p><p >Users can download manual backups of their live data at any time.</p><p >For a permanent disaster impacting one server only, our Disaster Recovery Plan
has the following metrics:
- RPO (Recovery Point Objective) = 5 minutes, i.e. can lose maximum 5 minutes of work
- RTO (Recovery Time Objective) = 30 minutes, i.e the service will be back online after maximum 30 minutes  (Standby promotion time + DNS propagation time included)</p><p >For data center disasters (one entire data center is completely and permanently
down), Disaster Recovery Plan has these metrics:
- RPO (Recovery Point Objective) = 24h, i.e. you can lose maximum 24h of work if the data cannot be recovered and we need to restore the last daily backup
- RTO (Recovery Time Objective) = 24h, i.e. the service will be restored from the backup within 24 hours in a different data center</p></section><section id="security"><h3 >4.5 Security</h3></section><section id="database-security"><h4 >Database Security</h4><p >Customer data is stored in a dedicated database - no sharing of data between
clients. Data access control rules implement complete isolation between customer
databases running on the same cluster, no access is possible from one database
to another.</p></section><section id="password-security"><h4 >Password Security</h4><p >Customer passwords are protected with industry-standard PBKDF2+SHA512
encryption (salted + stretched for thousands of rounds).</p><p >Odoo staff does not have access to your password, and cannot retrieve it for
you, the only option if you lose it is to reset it Login credentials are always
transmitted securely over HTTPS.</p></section><section id="system-security"><h4 >System Security</h4><p >All web connections to client instances are protected with state-of-the-art
256-bit SSL encryption. All our SSL certificates use robust 2048-bit modulus
with full SHA-2 certificates chains. Our servers are kept under a strict
security watch, and always patched against the latest SSL vulnerabilities,
enjoying Grade A SSL ratings at all times.</p><p >All Odoo online servers are running hardened Linux distributions with
up-to-date security patches. Installations are ad-hoc and minimal to limit the
number of services that could contain vulnerabilities (no PHP/MySQL stack for
example)</p><p >Only a few trusted Odoo engineers have clearance to remotely manage the servers
- and access is only possible using SSH key pairs (password authentication
disallowed)</p><p >Firewalls and intrusion counter-measures help prevent unauthorized access.
Automatic Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) mitigation is implemented in EU
and US data centers, and coming soon in Asia.</p></section><section id="staff-access"><h4 >Staff Access</h4><p >Odoo helpdesk staff may sign into your account to access settings related to
your support issue. For this they use their own special staff credentials, not
your password (which they have no way to know).</p><p >This special staff access improves efficiency and security: they can
immediately reproduce the problem you are seeing, you never need to share your
password, and we can audit and control staff actions separately!</p><p >Our Helpdesk staff strives to respect your privacy as much as possible, and
only access files and settings needed to diagnose and resolve your issue</p></section><section id="physical-security"><h4 >Physical Security</h4><p >The Odoo Online servers are hosted in several data centers worldwide, that must
all satisfy with our minimum physical security criterions:
- Physical access to the data center area where Odoo servers are located is restricted to data center technicians only
- Security cameras are monitoring the data center locations</p></section><section id="credit-cards-safety"><h4 >Credit Cards Safety</h4><p >When you sign up for a paid Odoo Online subscription, we do not store your
credit card information. Your credit card information is only transmitted
securely between you and our PCI-Compliant payment acquirers: Ingenico and
Paypal (even for recurring subscriptions)</p></section><section id="software-security"><h4 >Software Security</h4><p >The codebase of Odoo is laregely distributed and, thus, is continuously under
examination by Odoo users and contributors worldwide. Community bug reports are
therefore one important source of feedback regarding security. We encourage
developers to audit the code and report security issues.</p><p >Odoo SA commits to sending a &quot;Security Advisory&quot; to the Customer for any
security Bug that are discovered in the Software, at least 2 weeks before
making the Security Advisory public, unless the Bug has already been disclosed
publicly by a third party.</p><p >Security Advisories include a complete description of the Bug, its cause, its
possible impacts on the Customer's systems, and the corresponding remedy for
each Covered Version.</p><p >The Customer understands that the Bug and the information in the Security
Advisory must be treated are Confidential Information as described in
<a href="#confidentiality-online" class="internal reference"><span class="std std-ref">6.4 Confidentiality</span></a> during the embargo period prior to the public
disclosure.</p><p >The Odoo R&amp;D processes have code review steps that include security aspects,
for new and contributed pieces of code. Odoo is designed in a way that prevents
introducing most common security vulnerabilities:</p><ul ><li >SQL injections are prevented by the use of a higher-level API that does not require manual SQL queries</li><li >XSS attacks are prevented by the use of a high-level templating system that automatically escapes injected data</li><li >The framework prevents RPC access to private methods, making it harder to introduce exploitable vulnerabilities</li><li >See also the OWASP Top Vulnerabilities section to see how Odoo is designed from the ground up to prevent such vulnerabilities from appearing.</li></ul><p >Odoo is regularly audited by independent companies that are hired by our
customers and prospects to perform audits and penetration tests. The Odoo
Security Team receives the results and takes appropriate corrective measures
whenever it is necessary. We can't however disclose any of those results,
because they are confidential and belong to the commissioners.</p><p >Odoo also has a very active community of independent security researchers, who
continuously monitor the source code and work with us to improve and harden the
security of Odoo. Our Security Program is described on our Responsible
Disclosure page: <a href="https://www.odoo.com/page/responsible-disclosure" class="external reference">https://www.odoo.com/page/responsible-disclosure</a>.</p></section><section id="upgrade-services"><i id="upgrade-online"></i><h3 >4.6 Upgrade Services</h3></section><section id="upgrade-service-for-the-software"><i id="upgrade-odoo-online"></i><h4 >Upgrade Service for the Software</h4><p >For the duration of this Agreement, the Customer can submit upgrade requests,
in order to convert a database of the Software from one Covered Version of the
Software to a more recent Covered Version (the &quot;Target Version&quot;).</p><p >This service provided through an automated platform in order to allow the Customer to perform
unattended upgrades once a previous version of the Customer's database has been successfully
upgraded for a Covered Version.
The Customer may submit successive upgrade requests for a database, and agrees to submit at least
1 upgrade request for testing purposes before submitting the final upgrade request.</p><p >It is the sole responsibility of the Customer to verify and validate the upgraded database in order
to detect Bugs, to analyze the impact of changes and new features implemented in the Target Version,
