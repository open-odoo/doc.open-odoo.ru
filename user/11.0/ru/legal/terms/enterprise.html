service desk email address or website form), and to start handling such Customer submissions
within 2 business days.</p><p >The Customer understands that Bugs caused by a modification or extension that is not part of the
official Software will not be covered by this service.</p><p >As soon as the Bug is fixed an appropriate remedy will be communicated to the Customer.</p><p >For Self-Hosting, if the bug has been addressed in a more recent revision of the Covered Version of the

third party.
Security Advisories include a complete description of the Bug, its cause, its possible impacts
on the Customer's systems, and the corresponding remedy for each Covered Version.</p><p >The Customer understands that the Bug and the information in the Security Advisory must be treated

channel (typically Odoo SA's upgrade service website), in order to convert a database of the Software
from one Covered Version of the Software to a more recent Covered Version (the &quot;Target Version&quot;).</p><p >For the Cloud Platform, upgrade requests are submitted directly from the control panel of the
Cloud Platform, and do not require any data upload. For Self-Hosting,
upgrade requests must include a complete backup copy of the Customer's database and the
associated data (typically obtained from the Backup menu of the Software). Where necessary for data
security or regulation reasons, the Upgrade Service includes an optional tool to anonymize
identifiable data inside a database before submitting the upgrade request, and a tool to restore
the anonymized data after the upgrade.</p><p >This service provided through an automated platform in order to allow the Customer to perform
unattended upgrades once a previous version of the Customer's database has been successfully
upgraded for a Covered Version.
The Customer may submit successive upgrade requests for a database, and agrees to submit at least
1 upgrade request for testing purposes before submitting the final upgrade request.</p><p >The Upgrade Service is limited to the technical conversion and adaptation of the Customer's database
to make it compatible with the Target Version, and the correction of any Bug directly caused by the
upgrade operation and not normally occurring in the Target Version.</p><p >It is the sole responsibility of the Customer to verify and validate the upgraded database in order
to detect Bugs, to analyze the impact of changes and new features implemented in the Target Version,

were installed in the database before the upgrade (except where applicable as foreseen in section

technical adaptation of third-party modules installed in the Customer's database and their
corresponding data in order to be compatible with the Target Version. The Customer will receive an
