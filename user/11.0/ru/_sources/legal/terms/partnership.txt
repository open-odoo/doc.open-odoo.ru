and its affiliates (collectively referred to as "ODOO")

AND:

_____________________________________________________________________________________,

a company having its registered office at

_____________________________________________________________________________________.

(Hereinafter referred to as “PARTNER”)

ODOO and PARTNER are individually referred to as a "Party" and collectively referred to as
"the Parties".

1 Purpose
=========
The purpose of this agreement is to set forth the conditions under which ODOO provides services to
PARTNER, access to the Odoo Enterprise Edition software, and under which PARTNER complies with the
obligations set out hereafter.

ODOO hereby appoints PARTNER, and PARTNER hereby accepts appointment, to be a non-exclusive partner
promoting and selling "Odoo Enterprise Edition" to customers.

PARTNER commits to do its best effort to sell Odoo Enterprise contracts to its clients.
To support that, PARTNER will market in priority the "Odoo Enterprise Edition" version to prospects
and customers. PARTNER still has the option to sell services on other versions of the software,
like "Odoo Community Edition", should it be needed.

2 Term of the Agreement
=======================
The duration of this Agreement (the “Term”) shall be one year beginning on the date of the signature.
It is automatically renewed for an equal Term, unless either party provides a written notice of
termination minimum 30 days before the end of the Term to the other party.


3 Access to Odoo Enterprise Edition
===================================

3.1 Project platform access
---------------------------
To help PARTNER promote Odoo Enterprise Edition, ODOO grants access to its project code repository
to PARTNER for all "Odoo Enterprise Edition" Apps, under the terms set forth in :ref:`appendix_p_a`
and the conditions restricted under this Agreement.
This access will be granted as of the signature of this agreement and be revoked when this agreement
is terminated.


.. _restrictions:

3.2 Restrictions
----------------
PARTNER commits to keep confidentiality of the source code of Odoo Enterprise Edition Apps
within its staff. Access to the source code of Odoo Enterprise Edition for customers is
governed by the Odoo Enterprise Subscription Agreement (version 4.0 and above).
PARTNER agrees to NOT redistribute this code to third parties without the written permission of ODOO.

Notwithstanding the above, PARTNER commits to wholly preserve the integrity of the
Odoo Enterprise Edition code that is required to verify the validity of usage of Odoo Enterprise
Edition and to collect statistics that are needed for that purpose.


4 Partnership Services
======================

4.1 Partnership levels
----------------------
The Odoo partner program consists of two types of partnerships and four levels;
“Learning Partners” is for companies who want everything necessary to start implementing Odoo,
without visibility as an official partner until they get the required experience;
“Official Partners” is for companies who want the visibility as Ready, Silver and Gold,
according to their experience with Odoo.
Partnership level granted to PARTNER depends on the annual new Odoo Enterprise revenue generated
for ODOO, the number of certified resources and the customer retention rate.
Renewals of existing contracts do not account for the partnership level, but PARTNER
still gets a commission on these contracts as stated in section :ref:`benefits`.

The table below summarizes the requirements for each partnership level.

+--------------------------------------------+------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
|                                            | Learning Partner | Official: Ready    | Official: Silver   | Official: Gold     |
+============================================+==================+====================+====================+====================+
| Annual New Net Odoo Enterprise Users Sold  |   0              |  10                | 50                 | 150                |
+--------------------------------------------+------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
| Certified Active Internal Resources        |   0              |  1                 |  2                 |  3                 |
+--------------------------------------------+------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
| Minimum retention rate                     |   n/a            |  n/a               | 70%                |  80%               |
+--------------------------------------------+------------------+--------------------+--------------------+--------------------+

Certifications are personal, so when a certified staff member leaves the company,
PARTNER must notify ODOO in order to update the number of certified resources active
for the partnership contract.

The level of partnerships will be reviewed quarterly by ODOO based on new Odoo Enterprise contracts
sold by PARTNER over the previous 12 months, official certifications granted to employees of the partner,
and customer retention rate.

"Official Partners" may be upgraded automatically to a higher level once they reach the requirements for that
higher partnership level. Silver and Gold partners that are not meeting their partnerships
requirements at the end of annual period may be assigned to a lower partnership level.
