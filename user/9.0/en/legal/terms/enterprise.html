Version of the Software as a remedy to a Bug.</p><p >When a Bug is fixed in any Covered Version, Odoo SA commits to fixing the Bug in all more recent

associated data (typically obtained from the Backup menu of the Software). Where necessary for data
security or regulation reasons, the Upgrade Service includes an optional tool to anonymize

the anonymized data after the upgrade.</p><p >This service provided through an automated platform in order to allow the Customer to perform
