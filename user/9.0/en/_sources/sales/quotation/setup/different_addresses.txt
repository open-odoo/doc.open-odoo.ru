How to use different invoice and delivery addresses?
====================================================

Overview
========

It is possible to configure different addresses for delivery and
invoicing. This is very useful, because it could happen that your clients
have multiple locations and that the invoice address differs from the
delivery location.

Configuration
=============

First, go to the Sales application, then click on 
:menuselection:`Configuration --> Settings` and activate the option 
**Enable the multiple address configuration from menu**.
