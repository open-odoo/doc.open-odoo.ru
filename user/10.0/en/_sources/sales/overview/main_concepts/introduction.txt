As a sales manager, closing opportunities with Odoo Sales is 
really simple.

I selected a predefined quotation for a new product line offer. 
The products, the service details are already in the quotation. 
Of course, I can adapt the offer to fit my clients needs. 

The interface is really smooth. I can add references, some 
catchy phrases such as closing triggers (*here, you save $500 
if you sign the quote within 15 days*). I have a beautiful and 
modern design. This will help me close my opportunities more 
easily. 

Plus, reviewing the offer from a mobile phone is easy. 
Really easy. The customer got a clear quotation with a 
table of content. We can communicate easily. I identified an 
upselling opportunity. So, I adapt the offer by adding more 
products. When the offer is ready, the customer just needs to sign 
it online in just a few clicks. 
Odoo Sales is integrated with major shipping services: UPS, Fedex, 
USPS and more. The signed offer creates a delivery order automatically.

That's it, I successfully sold my products in just a few clicks.

Oh, I also have the transaction and communication history 
at my fingertips. It's easy for every stakeholder to know 
clearly the past interaction. And any information related 
to the transaction.

-   If you want to show information, I would do it from a customer 
    form, something like:
        
    - Kanban of customers, click on one customer
        
    - Click on opportunities, click on quotation
        
    - Come back to customers (breadcrum)
     
    - Click on customer statement letter

Anytime, I can get an in-depth report of my sales activity. 
Revenue by salespeople or department. Revenue by category of 
product, drill-down to specific products, by quarter or month,... 
I like this report: I can add it to my dashboard in just a click. 

Odoo Sales is a powerful, yet easy-to-use app. At first, I used 
the sales planner. Thanks to it, I got tips and tricks to boost 
my sales performance. 

Try Odoo Sales now and get beautiful quotations, amazing dashboards 
and increase your success rate.
