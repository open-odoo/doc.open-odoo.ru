How to check that everything is working fine?
=============================================

Vendor Bills
============

Even if you don't have the rights to the accounting application, you can
still control the vendor bills.

Go to the **Purchases** application: :menuselection:`Control --> Vendor Bills`.

Procurements exceptions
=======================

Here, you need the **Inventory Manager** access rights.

Go to the **Inventory** application: :menuselection:`Control --> Procurement Exceptions`.

To understand why the procurement is not running, open the exception and
check the message in the chatter.

Usually, the problem is located on the procurement rules. Either there
are no stock rules, or there are no vendor associated to a product.
